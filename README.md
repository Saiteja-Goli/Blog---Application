## Technologies Used

This project leverages the following technologies:

- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format. It is used as the backend database to manage and store information about movies.

- **Express.js**: A server-side web application framework for Node.js that simplifies the creation of robust APIs. The Express.js framework is utilized to handle HTTP requests, define routes, and interact with the MongoDB database.

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, developed by Facebook. It allows for the creation of reusable UI components. The front-end of this project is built using React, providing a dynamic and interactive user experience.

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime that allows developers to run JavaScript code on the server side. In this project, Node.js is used as the server-side runtime environment to execute server-side logic, handle requests, and serve the React application.

These technologies, collectively known as the MERN stack, enable a full-stack JavaScript development environment, providing flexibility, scalability, and efficiency in building modern web applications.
